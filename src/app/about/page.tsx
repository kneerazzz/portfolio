          Yo, I&apos;m <span className="font-semibold">Neeraj</span> (but most people
          online just know me as <span className="font-semibold">Troyy</span>).
          I&apos;m <span className="font-semibold">18</span>, currently grinding
          through my <span className="font-semibold">2nd year of college</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I actually started coding just a year ago ‚Äî the day I finally got my
          own laptop. At first, I was like, ‚Äúok bet, I&apos;ll learn C++ and master
          DSA in 4 months.‚Äù I did around 15‚Äì20 LeetCode questions and some other
          random ones... then promptly fell off üò≠. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Web dev is where I really went off. During my 1st sem break, I helped
          a friend (crato) with some CSS doubts and ended up deep diving myself. First
          thing I built? A budget Amazon clone. Then came weather apps, food
          search apps using APIs, and a bunch of smaller stuff that honestly
          doesn&apos;t even count anymore. The first ‚Äúreal‚Äù projects I actually stuck
          with were my YouTube-like backend and{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">SkillSprint</span>.

        <p>
          Originally, SkillSprint was just supposed to be a chill app that gave
          you a random 5-min topic daily to learn. Simple, right? But nah‚Ä¶ I
          kept adding features until it turned into a whole gamified learning
          platform. Now you can create a skill, build a plan around it, and the
          AI actually generates detailed breakdowns and explanations. It tracks
          your progress, pushes you with challenges, and makes learning way less
          boring. Basically, what started as a ‚Äúmini tool‚Äù spiraled into a full
          product. Check it out:{" "}

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Linux Chaos</h2>
        <p>
          Now, this part makes people think I&apos;m some hacker or sysadmin god,
          but nah bro ‚Äî I just copy paste commands from the internet and pray
          they work üòù. I first installed Linux back in December because I was
          like ‚ÄúWindows is slowing down‚Äù (mind you, I had literally bought my
          laptop 4 months ago). For some reason I felt this urge to just nuke it
          and throw Linux Mint on. Used that for like 4 months, then of course
          I tried deleting it, broke the whole system, panicked, and had to get
          a friend to help me reinstall. That&apos;s how I ended up on{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Arch Linux</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment I got Arch running I felt like one of those ‚Äúbtw I use Arch‚Äù
          elitists. At first I was just vibing on Plasma, customizing widgets
          and themes, but then I got greedy and jumped to Hyprland. Did I write
          configs myself? Hell no ‚Äî I stole someone else&apos;s dotfiles and just
          started tweaking. And bro, I LOVED it. Fast navigation, sexy app
          launcher, fastfetch flexing in the terminal ‚Äî all that good stuff. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I&apos;m still daily driving Arch + Hyprland like a clown who
          pretends to know what he&apos;s doing, when in reality it&apos;s just me,
          my broken configs, and ChatGPT holding my hand whenever I break
          something again. But fr, it&apos;s the best setup I&apos;ve used.
